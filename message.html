<h1>Happy Birthday to my most fav person 🤍🫂</h1>

<div class="message">
I truly believe that,We met because it was written in our destiny 😇.
Out of all the people in this world, somehow our paths crossed and that will always feel magical to me ✨❤️

I am the happiest person when I am with you 💝
You have always been my safe place ❤️‍🩹, my comfort 🫀 and my home 🫂
You are my most favorite blessing 🥹,my most favorite wish that came true 🫶🏻🫂,
something I once hoped for without even knowing it would become this beautiful 😍♾️🫶🏻

We were so close, inseparable even...And yes, life brought small misunderstandings that created a big distance between us 😫🥺
But even if we are not as close as we were used to be, you still hold the  same place in my heart.
And that will never change.🫂🫀
Some bonds are not measured by daily conversations,
they are measured by the depth they leave in our souls 💓and ours is one of them.

On your birthday, I just want you to know that you are loved and appreciated more than words can explain.
I will always be grateful that destiny chose us to meet ♾️🫶🏻🤍💝✨🫀🧿🫂

Happy Birthday Aravinduuuu 🤍✨
